AlgoGlimps: A Full-Stack Graph Algorithm Visualizer
AlgoGlimps is an interactive, full-stack web application designed to visualize and teach fundamental graph algorithms. The project provides a dynamic platform for users to build custom graphs and observe the step-by-step execution of algorithms in real-time.

Features
Interactive Graph Editor: Create and manipulate custom graphs by adding, moving, and removing nodes and edges with weights.

Real-Time Visualization: Watch the live execution of algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, and Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's).

AI-Powered Learning: Integrate the Gemini API to provide on-demand, context-aware explanations of each algorithm and its logic.

Cloud-Native Deployment: The application is containerized with Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Run for a scalable, portable, and reproducible environment.

Technology Stack
Backend: Java, Spring Boot, REST API

Frontend: HTML Canvas, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS

Tools & DevOps: Docker, Maven, Git, Google Cloud Run
