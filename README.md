### AlgoGlimps: A Full-Stack Graph Algorithm Visualizer

AlgoGlimps is an interactive, full-stack web application designed to visualize and teach fundamental graph algorithms. The project provides a dynamic platform for users to build custom graphs and observe the step-by-step execution of algorithms in real-time.

-----

### Features

  * **Interactive Graph Editor:** Create and manipulate custom graphs by adding, moving, and removing nodes and edges with weights.
  * **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch the live execution of algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, and Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's).
  * **AI-Powered Learning:** Integrate the **Gemini API** to provide on-demand, context-aware explanations of each algorithm and its logic.
  * **Cloud-Native Deployment:** The application is containerized with **Docker** and deployed on **Google Cloud Run** for a scalable, portable, and reproducible environment.

-----

### Technology Stack

  * **Backend:** **Java**, **Spring Boot**, REST API
  * **Frontend:** HTML Canvas, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
  * **Tools & DevOps:** Docker, Maven, Git, **Google Cloud Run**
